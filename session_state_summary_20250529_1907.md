**Project:** YTWatchLaterAI - A web application to manage YouTube "Watch Later" playlists. Users can authenticate, select a playlist, and receive AI-powered suggestions for videos within that playlist based on natural language queries.

**Current State of Backend Cloud Functions (Node.js):**
*   **`handleYouTubeAuth`**: Manages the OAuth 2.0 callback from Google for YouTube API authentication. Stores tokens in Datastore.
*   **`listUserPlaylists`**: Fetches the authenticated user's YouTube playlists using the YouTube Data API.
*   **`getWatchLaterPlaylist`**:
    *   Fetches all video items for a user-selected `playlistId`.
    *   For each video, it retrieves detailed metadata: title, description, original publication date, channel information, duration (from ISO 8601), view/like counts, and topic categories (translated from Wikidata URLs to human-readable names or entity IDs).
    *   Duration is processed into two forms: `durationSeconds` (total seconds, stored in Datastore and used for LLM context) and a formatted `HH:MM:SS` string (for display).
    *   Video metadata is stored/updated in Google Cloud Datastore.
    *   **Caching Logic:** Implemented to optimize performance. On request, it first fetches only the `videoId`s from the YouTube playlist. It compares this set of current IDs with the `videoId`s already stored in Datastore for that `playlistId_original`. If the sets are identical (membership hasn't changed, order ignored), it serves the full video details directly from Datastore. Otherwise, it proceeds to fetch fresh data from YouTube/Wikidata for all items, updates Datastore, and then returns the data.
    *   A Datastore composite index on the `Videos` kind (properties: `playlistId_original`, `videoId`) is required and has been defined in `index.yaml` and deployed.
*   **`chatWithPlaylist`**:
    *   Receives a user's text `query` and the `playlistId`.
    *   Fetches all video data for the specified `playlistId` from Datastore.
    *   Constructs a detailed JSON context string for each video, including `ID`, `Title`, `Description` (snippet), `DurationSeconds`, `Views`, `Likes`, `Topics` (joined string), and `PublishedTimestamp` (Unix ms).
    *   Sends this context and the user query to the Gemini Pro API via a single-shot prompt.
    *   The prompt instructs Gemini to return a JSON object structured as: `{ "suggestedVideos": [{ "videoId": "...", "reason": "..." }, ...] }`.
    *   Includes robust JSON parsing logic to handle Gemini's response, attempting to extract the first valid JSON object even if there's extraneous text or markdown.
    *   For each suggested video, it retrieves the full video details from the `videosForPlaylist` array (fetched from Datastore) and adds the `reason` from Gemini. It also explicitly formats `durationSeconds` into a displayable `duration` string before sending to the frontend.

**Current State of Frontend (React - `frontend/src/App.js`, `frontend/src/App.css`):**
*   Handles OAuth redirect and an "auto-login" check on page load (attempts to call `listUserPlaylists` to verify session).
*   Displays a list of the user's YouTube playlists for selection.
*   Upon playlist selection, calls `getWatchLaterPlaylist`. Instead of displaying the full video list, it now shows a temporary success/error popup message (toast notification) indicating the number of videos loaded.
*   Provides a chat interface (`ChatInterface` component) for users to submit queries about the selected playlist.
*   Displays suggested videos in a `VideoList` component. Each item shows:
    1.  Video Thumbnail (`video.thumbnailUrl`)
    2.  Title (`video.title`)
    3.  Formatted Duration (`video.duration`)
    4.  Description snippet (`video.description`)
    5.  Reason for suggestion from Gemini (`video.reason`)
    6.  A "ðŸ“º Watch" link that opens the video on YouTube in a new tab.
*   **UI Features:**
    *   Responsive design using CSS media queries.
    *   Playlist selector: Label, dropdown, and a "Refresh" icon button (ðŸ”„) stay in a row.
    *   Chat input: Text input and a "Send" icon button (âž¤) stay in a row.
    *   Icon buttons are styled to be borderless/backgroundless.
    *   A global loading overlay (`LoadingOverlay` component) with a spinner is displayed during long-running asynchronous operations (auth check, playlist fetch, chat query).
    *   A temporary status popup (`StatusPopup` component) for success/error messages (e.g., after playlist loading).
    *   The "Suggested Videos" heading dynamically shows the count (e.g., "5 Suggested Videos") or "No Suggestions Found". The user's last query is displayed below this heading.

**Recent Accomplishments & Fixes (leading up to this save state request):**
*   Successfully implemented and tested the caching logic in `getWatchLaterPlaylist`.
*   Addition of the necessary Datastore index.
*   Refinement of the Gemini prompt in `chatWithPlaylist` for structured responses with reasons.
*   Significant improvements to JSON parsing in `chatWithPlaylist`.
*   UI enhancements: dynamic "Suggested Videos" heading, display of the user's query, addition of duration and watch links to suggested videos, icon buttons, responsive layout adjustments, loading overlay, and status popups.
*   The most recent fix was ensuring the formatted `duration` string is correctly included in the data sent from `chatWithPlaylist` to the frontend, so it appears in the suggested video list.

**Pending Issues/Immediate Next Steps Before Interruption:**
*   **The primary immediate next step was for you (the user) to test the application after the latest deployment of `chatWithPlaylist` (which included the fix for the `duration` field in suggested videos).**
    *   Specifically, to verify that the "Duration" now appears correctly for each item in the "Suggested Videos" list in the UI.
    *   Also, to re-check if the robust JSON parsing in `chatWithPlaylist` has resolved previous issues with Gemini's responses (e.g., when it returned duplicated JSON for the "biographies" query).
*   The ESLint warnings in the frontend build (`'videos' is assigned a value but never used` and `'setIsLoading' is assigned a value but never used` in `App.js`) are minor and can be addressed later if desired.

**How to Reload This Context After Restart:**
After the extension restarts and you begin a new session, please provide this summary as the initial context. You can say, "Cline, let's resume our work. Here's the state summary from our last session:" followed by this text. I will then be up-to-date.
