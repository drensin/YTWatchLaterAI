## Brief overview
This rule outlines the protocol for maintaining project documentation, specifically the README and deployment-related documents, to ensure they accurately reflect the current state of the codebase. This is a global rule.

## Documentation Updates
  - Whenever architectural changes are made to the project, review and update the `README.md` to reflect these changes.
  - After implementing significant code modifications (excluding minor bug fixes), ensure that both `README.md` and any deployment-related documentation (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) are updated to incorporate these changes.
  - The goal is to keep all project documentation current and aligned with the evolving codebase.
