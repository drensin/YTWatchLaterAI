## Brief overview
This rule outlines the initial steps to take when starting a new task to ensure proper context and understanding of the project. This is a global rule.

## Task Initiation
  - Before beginning any new task, review the project's `README.md` file to understand the project's purpose, setup, and general structure.
  - Additionally, consult the `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file (or any deployment-related documentation) to be aware of deployment processes and considerations that might affect development choices.
  - When the task goals are defined, please overwrite (or create, as needed) the file state.md with a detailed description of the task. When a plan to execute the task has been agreed to, please add those details to state.md. As we acheive important milestones in the task, please update state.md to reflecte our progress. The purpose of state.md is to make is easy for us to pickup where we left off in case of a system restart or error.
