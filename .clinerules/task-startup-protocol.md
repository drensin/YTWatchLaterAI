## Brief overview
This rule outlines the initial steps to take when starting a new task to ensure proper context and understanding of the project. This is a global rule.

## Task Initiation
  - Before beginning any new task, review the project's `README.md` file to understand the project's purpose, setup, and general structure.
  - Additionally, consult the `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file (or any deployment-related documentation) to be aware of deployment processes and considerations that might affect development choices.
